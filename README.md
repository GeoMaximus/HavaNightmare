   As the title says my realtionship with java was not always a pretty one. It started off rough, but with time we understood eachother's differences and accepted each other for who we really are. 
    
   The repo covers everything from basic **class construction, custom exceptions, difference between shallow and deep copies**, up to **Java8 concepts (Streams, Optional, Lambda expressions)**. For the adventurous ones you may also find **Thread examples** (Synchronized threads, thread pool etc.), **Database connection **and operations as well as** TCP UDP servers**.
  
  
  Enjoy! But don't forget to practice yourself!
**  Stay curious!**
