<font size=8> As the title says my realtionship with java was not always a pretty one. <br>
  It started off rough, but with time we understood eachother's differences and accepted <br>
  each other for who we really are <br>
  The repo covers everything from basic class construction, custom exceptions, difference <br>
  between shallow and deep copies, up to Java8 concepts (Streams, Optional, Lambda expressions). <br>
  For the adventurous ones you may also find Thread examples (Synchronized threads, thread pool etc.), <br>
  Database connection and operations as well as TCP UDP servers. <br>
  
  Enjoy! But don't forget to practice yourself! </font>
